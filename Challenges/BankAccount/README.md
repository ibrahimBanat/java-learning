# Classes Challenge: Building a Bank Account
## Introduction
In the previous videos, I have been discussing classes. It is now time for a challenge to test your understanding of those concepts.

## Challenge: Building a Bank Account Class
Here is the task:

1. Create a new class for a bank account.
2. Add fields for account characteristics:
- account number
- account balance
- customer name
- email
- phone number
- Create getters and setters for each field.
- Add two additional methods:
- one for depositing funds
- one for withdrawing funds
- Ensure a customer cannot withdraw funds if that withdrawal would make their balance negative.

- Create a new project called ClassesChallenge with the usual Main class and main method.

- Create an instance of the Account class and test the withdraw and deposit methods.

- Print information to the console to confirm the balance after each method call.
